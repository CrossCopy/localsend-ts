> A TypeScirpt implementation of the LocalSend protocol

LocalSend provides a documentation for their protocol at https://github.com/localsend/protocol

I've seen some implementations in rust

- https://crates.io/crates/localsend
- https://github.com/tom8zds/localsend_rs

I want to build a LocalSend integration extension for my project https://github.com/kunkunsh/kunkun

So I decided to build a TypeScript implementation of the LocalSend protocol.
